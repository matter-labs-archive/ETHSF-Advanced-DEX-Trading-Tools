## Inspiration
"Crypto trading happens right from traders' wallets, on-chain" (From [Loopring website](https://loopring.org/))

## What it does
The main feature for Loopring Wallet - it's own URL-scheme for the possibility to open or download wallet and send transactions, trade on Loopring DEX and do whatever you want.
During developments we did the full analysis of the wallet and made a bunch of improvements:
- new UI elements
- improvement in UX
- fixed bugs with autocompletion and logic structure

## How we built it
Coded a native swift app in XCode

## Challenges we ran into
12 hours to get into the new field. Thanks to the Loopring team for collaboration!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Trading works in the right way in the end. :tada:

## What we learned
DEX trading is a new trend in the Blockchain community, and there is a lack of full-featured implementation of good end users interfaces. So we decide to change this!

## What's next for Loopr Wallet Enhancements
We plan to become further involved in the development of potential leader DEX exchanges
